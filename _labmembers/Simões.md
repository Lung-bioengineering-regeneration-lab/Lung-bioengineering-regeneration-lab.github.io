Assisted by Dr. Darcy Wagner´s team and Dr. John Stegmayr on developing an efficient technique to reverse solvent-based optical clearing of whole organs, allowing to support the data obtained with light sheet fluorescence microscopy using histology-based staining methods like H&E, Masson's trichrome, or immunofluorescence.
