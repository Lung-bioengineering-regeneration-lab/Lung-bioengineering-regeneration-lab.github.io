I’m Leonor, a PhD candidate at McGill University, working at the Meakins-Christie Laboratories within the RI-MUHC. My research builds on my bachelor’s thesis, focusing on light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) and the protocols required for processing samples with this advanced imaging technology. Microscopy and histology have long been passions of mine, ones that have only deepened as I’ve immersed myself further in the scientific world.

Beyond imaging, I have a strong interest in Regenerative Medicine, which led me to pursue my master’s degree in the field. During my PhD, I will also work on translating lung regeneration research into real-world applications, bridging the gap between discovery and clinical impact.

I am always eager to learn new techniques and expand my skill set. Equally important to me is sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration. I enjoy making others part of my work, whether by exchanging ideas, discussing methodologies, or guiding them through the techniques I use.
