I am a Medical Doctor and Pharmacist with postgraduate training in Pharmaceutical Research and Development, and over a decade of experience spanning R&D, Quality Assurance, Regulatory Affairs, and Medical Affairs in the pharmaceutical industry. My professional journey took a transformative turn when I encountered Regenerative Medicine, a field where I discovered my true passion.

At the LBR, where we are developing advanced therapeutic products, I bring my expertise to support the clinical translation of these innovations, a fundamental step in making cell and gene therapies not only available but also truly accessible to patients in need. I am particularly committed to ensuring that every stage of this process is conducted in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), thereby safeguarding patient welfare while meeting the highest regulatory expectations.
