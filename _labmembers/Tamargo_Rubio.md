##### About me
Hello! I was born and reaised in Madrid, Spain. I received my degree in pharmacy from the University Complutense of Madrid in 2019. My interest in advanced therapies, led me to study a master's degree at the Universidad Francisco de Vitoria, Madrid. In this master course, called “Advanced Therapies and Biotechnological Innovation", I expanded my knowledge in fields such as nanotechnology, genetic engineering, stem cells or tissue engineering. At this moment, I am preparing my final master ´s thesis in Darcy Wagner's laboratory with the aim of becoming a great researcher one day.

##### Master´s Thesis Project
Chronic lung diseases are one of the top 3 causes of death worldwide. For patients who are not helped sufficiently by medications alone and that suffer from pulmonary diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis, the only medium to long term solution is lung transplantation. However, donor tissue is very scarce in relation to demand, in addition, long-term survival when lung transplantation is performed is much lower than with other types of organs. 

A possible solution to this problem, is tissue engineering. Within this discipline, organ decellularization is an emerging technique for generating a scaffold which can be subsequently reseeded with cells with the goal of generating functional tissue. The goal of decellularization is to eliminate native cells using chemical and physical methods while maintaining the 3D structure of the organ during the process. This three-dimensional scaffold could be reseeded with cells from a transplant candidate, thus minimizing rejection. The decellularization process in lungs has been carried out via blood vessels and through the airways, separately and in combination. Recellularization has been achieved via the same major access routes in the lung.

In the lungs, we find another very important system that plays a crucial role in transplantation: the lymphatic system. Lymphatic vessels are essential for the uptake of fluid, immune cells, macromolecules and lipids from the interstitial space. This molecule drainage plays an essential role in maintaining interstitial fluid balance in the lung allograft. However, this system is completely disrupted during lung transplant surgery and the effect of this disruption in lung transplant is still not known. 
In addition, this system has not been explored as a new possible pathway for decellularization and recellularization techniques, but since it is a network that extends throughout the organ, it could bring significant advantages over traditional techniques, especially in fibrotic lungs in which due to the over expression of collagen, the detergents used to decellularize penetrate with greater difficulty.

For my master´s thesis, I will explore the potential role of the lymphatic vessels during de- and recellularization of lung tissue.
