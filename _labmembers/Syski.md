Hello! 
My name is Thomas Syski, born in Warsaw, Poland but mostly raised in Sweden. I have a background from LTH in Lund in Biomedical Engineering. 
Did my B.Sc. project at The Faculty of Biology at Lund University working on the project "Utilization of Electrospinning and Electrospray for the creation of Bioresorbable 3D Scaffolds." 
Currently working here at LBR with my M.Sc. project: "3D bioprinting of multiple cell types into structures resembling human airways".
