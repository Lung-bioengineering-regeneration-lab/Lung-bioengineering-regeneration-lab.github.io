##### About me
Hello! I am a PhD student trying to find solutions for next generation bioengineering of lung tissue for transplantation. During my free time I like to be in the nature and love most outdoor activities including skiing, hiking and hunting for mushrooms. 

##### Popular Summary
For many patients with end-stage lung diseases, lung transplantation is the only option to save their lives. However, there are not enough lungs to meet the clinical demand. Because of this, many scientists are looking into making new lungs in the lab, also known as lung bioengineering.  
During the PhD I have investigated key aspects of lung bioengineering and bioengineering as a whole with a focus on 3D bioprinting, that is to print materials (known as bioinks) together with cells. Investigating the bioinks, cell types and bioprinting methods that allow for viable tissue is important and I have developed of a bioink which can be bioprinted together with lung cells to make small airways.   
The lung is made out of cells and proteins (known as ECM) that support the cells and tells them how to behave. To develop a bioink that is biologically close to lungs, lung ECM is combined with a material that can easily be made into different shapes: alginate.  The combination of alginate and ECM results in a bioink which we call reinforced extracellular matrix (rECM) bioink. rECM bioinks can be 3D bioprinted together with patient cells into small airways that remain patent over time.  
After the bioprinting, the patient cells stay alive and behave consistently to native small airways. When transplanted into mice the material integrates in the surrounding tissue with blood vessel and capillary formation. 
This work is a critical stepping stone for future studies looking into generating tissue via 3D bioprinting and which could result ideally one day into a source of lung tissue for transplantation purposes.
