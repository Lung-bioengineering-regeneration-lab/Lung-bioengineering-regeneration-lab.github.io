I am a student guest researcher at Lund University, working within the Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration Lab. My research focuses on optimizing the reverse clearing technique for extracellular matrix analysis using FTIR spectroscopy and computational modeling with COMSOL Multiphysics. By integrating experimental data with simulation-based approaches, I aim to enhance tissue clearing protocols.
