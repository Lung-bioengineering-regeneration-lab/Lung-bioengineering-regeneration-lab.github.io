Hi, my name is Indra. I am a Master in Biomedicine student at Lund University and originally from Indonesia. Within the Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration Lab, I am working on my master degree project on developing a high-throughput lung ALI culture-based platform from primary human bronchial basal cells for COVID-19 prophylaxis drug screening. With my basic as medical doctor, I am naturally enticed with basic researches that is leaning on the translational side and this platform will hopefully be useful not only for the purpose of COVID-19 drug screening, but also for general use in high-throughput lung-related researches. In my free time I love to do music and I am singing together with Lunds Students√•ngare as a Tenor.
