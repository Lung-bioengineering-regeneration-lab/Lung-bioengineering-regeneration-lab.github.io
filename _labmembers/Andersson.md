I am an engineering student doing my final semester at LTH in Lund. During my education, I have found that my biggest interests lie in the field of tissue engineering, regeneration and biomaterials and I am very excited to be working with these areas in my thesis project in the LBR lab.

My project aims to investigate what type of ECMs, stemming from either human sources or xenogeneic sources with desired properties, can be used for generating bioinks with the focus on clinical translation, scalability and reproducibility. I will also investigate if these hydrogels supports growth, proliferation and possibly differentiation of different cell types.
