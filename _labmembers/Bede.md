I am a fourth-year bioengineering student at McGill University with a broad interest in the intersection of engineering and biology, whether that be in tissue engineering, environmental engineering, life-sustaining systems in space, or conservation research. I just completed the SURE (Summer Undergraduate Research Experience) program at the environmental engineering lab at McGill, where I worked on the design of primers for near full-length amplification and characterization of antimicrobial resistance genes in wastewater and drinking water in the Montérégie area of Quebec. I am continuing my work part-time at this lab. I am also involved in the payload subteam of the McGill Rocket Team, where I have worked on an experiment to test pull-out strength of spinal pedicle screws to assess their potential in preventing screw micromotion during rocket flight.

I am currently working on my engineering capstone project at the LBR lab where I look forward to broadening my knowledge and experience with tissue and cell culture engineering. My team and I are focusing on the design of an open-source 3D bioprinter with multi-extrusion capabilities to produce complex, multicellular structures appropriate for transplantation.
