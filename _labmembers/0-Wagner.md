##### About me
I was born and raised in Toledo, Ohio in the United States and received my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, USA. I conducted my PhD studies in Dr. Sarit Bhaduri's lab at the University of Toledo where I focused on using microwave processing to generate calcium phosphate nanoparticles for gene therapy and for bone tissue engineering. I went on to do my first postdoctoral training in Dr. Daniel Weiss' lab at the University of Vermont in the Vermont Lung Center where I was an NIH T32 Fellow and developed protocols to decellularize whole lungs from different species and diseases, including human. I then moved to Munich, Germany to do a second postdoctoral training period in Dr. Melanie Königshoff's lab at the Comprehensive Pneumology Center (a joint venture between the Ludwig Maximilians University, Helmholtz Center Munich and the Asklepios Clinic). There I focused on the derangement of distal lung epithelial progenitor cells in normal and diseased repair and regeneration.  

I started my group 'Lung Bioenigneering and Regeneration' in 2017 at Lund University as part of the newly formed Wallenberg Center for Molecular Medicine, with a focus on regenerative medicine. I am currently an Associate Professor and Docent in the Faculty of Medicine at Lund University and head of the Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration Group. I am a Principal Investigator in the Lund Wallenberg Molecular Medicine Center as well as the Lund Stem Cell Center. My lab focuses on generation of lung tissue ex vivo for eventual transplantation and building new humanized models of lung tissue to study chronic diseases and evaluate potential therapies. My work takes a multidisciplinary approach using advances in materials science, manufacturing, and lung stem cell biology to construct these new models.
I was selected in 2017 as one of the American Thoracic Society’s ‘Rising Stars of Research’ and was awarded the Carol Basbaum Award by the American Thoracic Society in 2018 – an award given to a young investigator who has demonstrated outstanding scientific achievement, mentorship, and leadership potential. My work is currently funded by the Wallenberg Molecular Medicine Fellowship and a European Research Council Starting Grant in 2018 on 3D bioprinting of lung tissue and a Swedish Research Council Starting Grant in 2018 to pursue mechanisms of repair in chronic lung diseases.
