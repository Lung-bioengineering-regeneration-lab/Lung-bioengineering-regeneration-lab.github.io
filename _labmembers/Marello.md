I am Letizia, an undergraduate student in Bioengineering at McGill University. I am driven by curiosity and love working in multidisciplinary environments where engineering meets biology. At the Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration lab (LBR) at the RI-MUHC, I have been exploring different aspects of tissue engineering and 3D bioprinting through several hands-on research projects.

My first project focused on optimizing protocols for hydrogels derived from decellularized lung extracellular matrix (dECM), with the goal of creating bioinks to 3D bioprint lung tissue and constructs. I am currently developing a 3D bioprinted model of breast cancer metastasis in the lungs to help better understand tumor progression in physiologically relevant models. My next project, as part of my engineering capstone, will involve designing and building a multi-extrusion 3D bioprinter capable of printing complex tissue structures, such as small airways.
