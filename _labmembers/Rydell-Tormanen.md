##### About me
I´m born and raised in Skåne, Sweden and received my first undergraduate degree, an MSc in Biology from Lund University. I conducted my PhD in the Airway Inflammation and Immunology group at Lund University, where I studied vascular remodeling in lungs following allergic airway inflammation, but also neutrophil responses following infectious airway inflammation. 

Following my PhD, I did a first postdoc in rheumatology (Lund University/Lund University Hospital) where I developed and described a model for systemic sclerosis/scleoderma, an autoimmune disease characterized by dermal fibrosis but commonly also in other organs such as kidney or lungs. I did a second postdoc in the Lung Biology group (Lund University) studying development of pulmonary fibrosis, mainly focusing on the effect of vascular inflammation in this process. Following this postdoc, I received a position as Assistant Professor, and during this time I started investigating the role of Wnt-signaling in development of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). 

I became a Docent (Reader/Associate Professor) in Experimental Pulmonary Medicine 2016, but realized I wanted to become an MD and work as a clinician. I thus went back to school to get a second degree, finishing in December 2020. During my education I have remained active as a researcher, seeking to merge a preclinical background with my clinical present and future. 

##### Popular Summary
My research focuses on embryological signaling pathways which are also essential in adult regeneration. In order to regenerate tissue after damage regenerative processes needs to be initiated, but also terminated at an appropriate time. If regeneration fails to start the tissue will not be restored, which is believed to occur in development of emphysema. However, if the regeneration is not terminated when the tissue is restored, the scar tissue will continue to accumulate resulting in fibrosis. Thus, the Swedish word “lagom” (meaning “just right”) is truly the golden standard when it comes to regeneration.

My research focuses on an embryonic signaling pathway known as Wnt/β-catenin-signaling, which is a key signaling pathway in embryological development but also in regeneration and tissue repair in adults. Wnt/β-catenin-signaling is involved in a number of fundamental biological processes, such as proliferation, migration and invasion, and are known to be dysregulated in many forms of cancer. 

β-catenin-signaling is known to be decreased in emphysema and increased in pulmonary fibrosis, but the mechanisms underlying this alternate regulation is unknown. My research focuses both on how normal endogenous control mechanisms fails, as well as on the possibility to normalize the signaling by pharmacological interventions.
