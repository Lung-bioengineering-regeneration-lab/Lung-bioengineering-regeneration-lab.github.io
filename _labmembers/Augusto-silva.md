##### How does air pollution affect lung health? 

Ambient air pollution accounts for an estimated 4.2 million deaths per year due to stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. Around 91% of the worldâ€™s population lives in places where air pollution levels exceed WHO limits. Exposure to pollutants contributes to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is lower than exposure to indoor pollutants. The WHO assumes that only 1% of COPD cases are caused by urban pollution in developed countries and the index in less developed countries goes to 2%. 
However, there is some evidence linking air pollution with the worsening of COPD, in addition to the fact that recognition of negative health outcomes at high levels of pollution and considering that the airways in turn the lung is the main point of entry for distribution of pollution particles to the rest of the body, since ultrafine particles are found in various organ. 

The presence of air pollution is not only related to COPD but also inflammation, development of COPD, increased risk of Alzheimer's development, and other adverse health effects including effects on fetal development through exposure of pregnant women to areas with high concentrations of pollutants. For this purpose, the evaluation of the regenerative capacity of lungs exposed or not to high concentrations of suspended material in the air is important. 

The central goal of this project is to investigate where these particles end up in the lung, what they are, and how they affect lung regeneration capacity.
