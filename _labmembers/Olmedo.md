“Regeneration reveals the hidden potential within tissues, turning the challenges of disease into opportunities for healing”
I’m Alfredo Moreno Olmedo, a PhD candidate in Experimental Medicine at McGill University, with a focus on lung tissue regeneration in lung disease. Before starting my PhD, I completed a specialization in Bioethics. I hold an MD from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and an MSc in Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine from the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom, where I worked on microporous 3D scaffolds for musculoskeletal tissue engineering.
My interest in regenerative medicine began in Xochimilco, my hometown in Mexico City (“where the flowers grow”), inspired by the extraordinary regenerative abilities of the axolotl. This experience motivated me to explore ways to restore damaged tissues, going beyond conventional medical approaches.
I attended the CAS-ANSO Summer Camp at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in Beijing, collaborating with researchers from diverse backgrounds. I also founded Neotissues, a startup dedicated to promoting knowledge in regenerative medicine, connecting experts, and making science more accessible to the public.
I am committed to advancing biomedical research while fostering global collaboration and sharing knowledge. I enjoy learning new techniques, exchanging ideas, and working with others to bridge the gap between discovery and real-world applications.
