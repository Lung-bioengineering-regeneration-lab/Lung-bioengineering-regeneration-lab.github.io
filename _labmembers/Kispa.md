My name is Tera Kispa, and I am a Master's student in Molecular Biology at Lund University. As part of the Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration group, my thesis focuses on characterizing Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) culture from human-derived airway cells on electrospun polycaprolactone to improve in vitro airway models.
Before my master’s program, I earned a Biology degree and worked for nearly nine years as a supporting researcher at Indonesia’s largest pharmaceutical state-owned enterprise. There, I contributed to a project with the National Referral Hospital to develop mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) for clinical use.
Outside the lab, I enjoy swimming and exploring several Skåne national parks. I am grateful to be part of this research group and look forward to contributing to lung bioengineering and regenerative medicine.
