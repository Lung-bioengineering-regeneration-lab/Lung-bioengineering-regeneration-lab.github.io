I am Osandi, an undergraduate student in Bioengineering at McGill University. I am interested in the intersection of cancer biology, tissue engineering, and mechanobiology, and enjoy working on research projects that integrate engineering principles with complex biological systems.

My previous research focused on the mechanobiology of prostate cancer, examining how androgen receptor signaling and microenvironment stiffness influence cell behavior and metastatic progression. This experience deepened my understanding of how mechanical cues regulate cellular behavior and continues to guide my approach to engineering biomimetic tissue environments.

For my engineering capstone project, I am working at the Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration lab (LBR) at the RI-MUHC to develop an open-source, multi-extrusion 3D bioprinter capable of fabricating multicellular, miniaturized tissue constructs. This project aims to overcome the limitations of commercial bioprinters and enable more physiologically relevant lung tissue models for advanced research.
