 I am a Medical Doctor graduated from Tbilisi State Medical University,Georgia. My passion for learning basic molecular mechanisms behind disease development and pathogenesis led me to join the Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration laboratory at Lund University as a research engineer.Currently I am involved in multidisciplinary projects such as the decellularization of different tissues, the establishment of different ARDS models in large animals and a drug screening project.
