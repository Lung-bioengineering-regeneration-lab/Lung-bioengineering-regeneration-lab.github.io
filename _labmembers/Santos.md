My name is Inés Mínguez Santos and I am a biomedicine student at Francisco de Vitoria University, in Madrid. I came to Lund to do my final thesis project, and become a better scientist. 
My research here consists in the identification of Yap/Taz binding partners in the context of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
