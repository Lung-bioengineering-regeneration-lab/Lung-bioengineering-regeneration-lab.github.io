I am Sondos Odeh, and I am a faculty member at the College of Science and Technology at Hebron University, Palestine. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biology and a Master’s degree in Molecular Genetics. where my thesis focused on studying the role of TET3 enzyme in breast tumorigenesis. This experience sparked my interest in cancer research and motivated me to further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor development. I was awarded the Palestine-Quebec Science Bridge Award, which brought me to Dr. Darcy Wagner's lab at McGill University, where I’m currently learning tissue bioengineering; a fascinating field that brings together biology and engineering. This hands-on experience is helping me build the skills I need to pursue a PhD in cancer sciences. I’m especially interested in creating models that mimic the tumor microenvironment in order to study cancer hallmarks such as invasion and metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, to explore how tumors grow and respond to treatment.
