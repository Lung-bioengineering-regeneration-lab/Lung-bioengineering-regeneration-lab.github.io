I was born and raised in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Pharmacy at Shenyang Pharmaceutical University in China. Currently I am doing my master studies in biomedicine at Lund University in Sweden. For thesis project, I am working on an ex vivo model of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
