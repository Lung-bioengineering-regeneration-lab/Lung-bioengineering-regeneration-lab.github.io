I am a clinician in China but also passionate about new therapies that could provide promising medicine. I was admitted to Nagoya University in April 2019 as a Ph.D. student, majoring in stomatology and studying clinical researches focused on its clinical application as an 'exit' of regenerative medicine research. By participating in a Joint-Degree Program between Nagoya University (Japan) and Lund University (Sweden) in 15 months since June 2021, I had a chance to join the group of Dr. Darcy Wagner, Lung bioengineering and regeneration (LBR) as a Ph.D. student, pursuing a project about bioengineering therapy in salivary gland regeneration.
Radiation therapy for malignant tumors of the head and neck can cause salivary gland dysfunction, which in turn causes a variety of serious oral diseases, such as rampant teeth and dysphagia, which seriously affect the quality of life of patients. At present, salivary gland dysfunction is mainly treated with drugs such as salivary fluid substitutes (artificial saliva) or sialogogue (pilocarpine). It not only has short curative effects, but also requires multiple long-term medications, but still has side effects that cannot be ignored. The most important thing for therapeutic effect of these treatments is closely related to the residual salivary gland functional cells after irradiation. Cell therapy is faced with deficiencies such as difficulty in extracting salivary gland stem/progenitor cells, high risks related to stem cell transplantation, and ethical issues. Other treatment methods include surgical displacement of the relevant glands in the radiation area before radiotherapy or the use of radioprotective agents, or the use of more advanced intensity-modulated radiation therapy to improve outcomes of radiotherapy. However, the former is an invasive operation; although the latter improves the accuracy of radiotherapy and may restore part of the salivary gland function, damage to the maxillofacial glands is unavoidable. In view of this, finding a more feasible treatment for salivary gland dysfunction has important clinical significance. My project is to explore the enigmatic mechanisms of radiosensitivity for salivary glands, also develop bioactive scaffolds to construct an organized branched structure with saliva-secretory function, hoping to provide more options for the recovery of salivary gland dysfunction and to repair the various disorders in its nearby tissues.
