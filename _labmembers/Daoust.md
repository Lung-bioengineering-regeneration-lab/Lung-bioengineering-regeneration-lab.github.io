I'm a fourth-year bioengineering student at McGill University. Last year, I was a wet lab member of the McGill iGEM team where I worked on nucle.io, a project leveraging DNA computing to diagnose sepsis. I am now part of the payload project for Rocket Team.

I recently had the opportunity to study abroad in Bologna, Italy, where I broadened my academic horizons. This experience strengthened my adaptability, cross-cultural communication skills, and ability to approach problems from multiple disciplinary perspectives.
