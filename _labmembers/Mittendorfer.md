##### About me
I grew up in a small village south of Vienna but came to Lund to study a Bachelor in Biomedicine at Lund University. At a mandatory presentation session during my studies I stumbled upon Dr. Darcy Wagner's research and her (at that time) newly started Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration Lab and was fascinated. After a good talk about how there is a general lack of mountains for skiing in Sk√•ne (the flattest part of Sweden) with Dr. Wagner, I ended up doing a summer research project in her lab. After that, I did my Bachelor's thesis project in the LBR and am currently back a third time to work on the recellularization of decellularized murine lungs for a 60-credit Master's project.
