Currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at McGill University, working at the Meakins-Christie Laboratories within the RI-MUHC. My research focuses on using cell-derived extracellular matrix and iPSC-derived cells to develop new approaches for lung tissue regeneration.

During my PhD studies in Dr. L'Heureux's lab at the University of Bordeaux, I focused on developing completely biological tissue-engineered vascular grafts and led a pre-clinical study in a large animal model. I went on a first postdoctoral position in Dr. Elliot Chaikof’ lab at Harvard Medical School, where I developped biomimetic ECM-based scaffolds and studied the use of human iPSC-derived cells for vascular regeneration.

Beyond laboratory research, I have a strong interest in innovation and translating lab findings from the bench to bedside, which led me to pursue a Master's degree in Biomedical Entrepreneurship.
