I am Berta, a fourth-year Biomedical Engineering student, and I am passionate about combining engineering with medicine to develop innovative solutions that improve peopleâ€™s health and quality of life. I am particularly interested in the field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, as they hold enormous potential to transform the future of biomedicine.

My current project focuses on the development of collagen hydrogels and how their self-assembly process can be influenced by changes in the ionic environment. The goal is to understand how these variations affect their structural and functional properties, and thus explore their potential as scaffolds for tissue engineering. With this knowledge, I aim to design advanced biomaterials inspired by the extracellular matrix, to be applied in innovative techniques such as bioprinting and cell encapsulation.
