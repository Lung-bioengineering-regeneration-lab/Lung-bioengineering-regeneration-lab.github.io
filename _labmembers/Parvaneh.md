name: "Shahram Parvaneh"
role: "Postdoctoral Fellow"
subtitle: "Shahram completed his PhD in Immunology at the Department of Dermatology and allergology of Szeged University, Hungary. His doctoral research focused on cancer biology, investigating the effects of bile acids on pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis and developing a 3D bioprinted tumor model to study the role of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) in tumor microenvironment–driven chemoresistance. He integrated transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying therapy resistance and tumor–stroma interactions. 

Before his PhD, Shahram earned a BSc in Clinical Laboratory Sciences and an MSc in Medical Immunology. He has broad experience in protein purification, immunochemistry, bioconjugation, biomaterial-based tissue engineering, and stem cell biology across both academic and industrial settings. 

Since 2023, Shahram has been working as a research engineer in the Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration (LBR) Group at Lund University. He is currently an IGNITE Fellow in the Wagner Lab, where he is developing a humanized airway organoid model to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a WHO priority pathogen that urgently requires new therapeutic strategies. His project involves creating apical-out airway organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to mimic physiological infection routes and integrating microfluidic systems to enable long-term co-culture with live bacteria."
