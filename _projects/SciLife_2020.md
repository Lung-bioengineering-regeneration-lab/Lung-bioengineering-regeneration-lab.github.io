## Popular Summary

In this project, we aim to develop and validate cryopreservation methods for human PCLS for use in ultimately studying SARS-CoV2 infection and evaluation of potential therapies. The development of cryopreservation techniques would allow many more experiments to be possible from a single human lung, but would also allow for the establishment of a biobank of cryopreserved PCLS (that could be used on-demand and shipped worldwide). Cryopreserved PCLS would allow testing of SARS-CoV2 in labs with access to the virus and appropriate BSL3 facilities. If fully realized, the infection model could then be run using a library of compounds with FDA/EMA approval for repurposing. As an alternative to the infection model, there has recently been reports of characterizing the late stages of infection, including characterization of the cytokine profile of patients who succumb versus those who survive. Our work previously used this approach of simultaneous exposure to multiple cytokines to develop an ex vivo model of fibrosis (Alsafadi et al. AJP-Lung 2017). This approach could be explored in parallel to identify drugs to combat lethal SARS.
