## Popular Summary

Many people with end-stage lung disease have no other option than to undergo lung transplantation. There are, however, not enough donor lungs to meet clinical demand, heightening the need for new options that can increase available tissue for lung transplantation. The EU-funded 3DBIOLUNG project will focus on generating lung tissue in the lab using bioengineering approaches and explore whether new advances in 3D printing and 3D bioprinting can be a possible option for lung tissue for transplantation. To do this, it will use custom 3D bioprinters to generate constructs imitating lung tissue, 3D bioprint hybrid murine and human lung tissue models, and test gas exchange, angiogenesis and in vivo immune responses.
