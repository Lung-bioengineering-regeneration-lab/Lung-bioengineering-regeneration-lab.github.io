## Popular Summary

As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, it has become increasingly clear that SARS-CoV-2 disproportionately effects different patient populations and that age and underlying co-morbidities are major predictors of mortality. In parallel, it is now well acknowledged that the general population is susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, but most patients remain asymptomatic and do not develop severe disease. Several potential vaccines have reached late phases of clinical trials, but even if a successful vaccine is identified soon, concerns will remain with administering a vaccine to the world population and technologies to ramp up production are still needed. During this time, it is critical to identify approaches to protect vulnerable patient populations so that society can begin to return to near normal. One potential option is to repurpose existing antiviral compounds which can prevent infection in vulnerable patients. Here, we will perform a medium throughput drug screen in primary human airway cells, a major site of SARS-CoV-2 infection, to identify approved antiviral compounds which could be repurposed for prophylactic SARS-CoV-2 therapy in vulnerable populations. Together with Cellevate AB, we have developed a new method for medium-high throughput drug screening of human airway cells which allows several hundred compounds to be evaluated on cells from individual patients. Furthermore, this assay is amenable to validation of compounds in human airway cells derived from patients with underlying co-morbidities associated with COVID-19. This approach has the potential to identify and repurpose antiviral compounds with previously established safety profiles to protect vulnerable patients until a vaccine is developed.
