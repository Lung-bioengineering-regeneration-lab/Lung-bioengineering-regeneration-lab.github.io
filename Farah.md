Iâ€™m Milana, an undergraduate student in Bioengineering at McGill University. I am passionate about tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and bioprinting. I believe these fields can help solve some of the biggest challenges in medicine, like organ shortage.

At the Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration Lab, I have worked on transforming an open-source 3D printer into a bioprinter for lung tissue applications, including performing technical evaluations and designing custom components. My next project, as part of my engineering capstone, will involve completing the development and design of this printer, turning it into a multi-extrusion 3D bioprinter capable of producing complex, multicellular constructs such as miniaturized lung airways for transplantation. The goal of this work is to create accessible, customizable, and low-cost bioprinting tools that can democratize research in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
