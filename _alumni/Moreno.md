My name is Alejandro Frías Moreno and I am a biotechnology and pharmacy student in the Francisco de Vitoria University, in Madrid. I am currently doing my thesis final project based on the comparison of ECM hydrogels with plastic surfaces or single ECM protein coatings to improve cell growth and differentiation on cell culture. During my internship I expect to improve my critical thinking and my laboratory skills.
