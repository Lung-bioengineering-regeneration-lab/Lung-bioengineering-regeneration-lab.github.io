I defended my thesis and got my PhD at Lund University in 2003, after that I did a PostDoc at Malm√∂ University Hospital, Sweden, and then worked in the private sektor for a few years. Since 2008 I am back at Lund University now on the administrative side of the research. I am deputy coordinator at Neuronano Research Center (NRC) and scientific coordinator in Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration, both at Lund University.
