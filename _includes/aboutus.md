The Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration (LBR) Lab originated at Lund University in 2017 and since 2024 is located at McGill University. We focus on growing new lung tissue in the lab for transplantation and for use in disease modeling. We use a multidisciplinary approach using advances in materials science (polymer design and synthesis), manufacturing (e.g. 3D bioprinting), and endogenous lung stem cells to construct this bioengineered tissue and these new models. Our work has previously been supported through a Wallenberg Molecular Medicine Fellowship, ERC Starting Grant and through the Swedish Research Council. We are currently supported by a Canadian Excellence Research Chair position in Lung Regenerative Medicine through the Canadian Tri-Agency.
