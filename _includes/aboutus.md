### Our research 
Over three million people die each year and over 60 million people suffer worldwide from chronic lung diseases (CLDs). Currently, there is no cure for CLDs, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary fibrosis. Lung transplantation is the only option at end-stage disease and is further complicated by shortage in organs available for transplantation and low efficacy. Five-year survival rate has remained at 50% for the last decade. New options are desperately needed for these patients. 

Our lab focuses on how the extracellular environment directs stem cell behavior for endogenous and exogenous lung tissue regeneration. We use a multidisciplinary approach using advances in materials science (polymer design and synthesis), manufacturing (e.g. 3D bioprinting), and endogenous lung stem cells to construct these new models. 


### Aims 
Design and use of biologic (acellular) and synthetic scaffolds to bioengineer new lung tissue for transplantation. 

Understand the role of the extracellular matrix in directing lung stem cell behaviour in vivo and ex vivo during regeneration (normal and pathologic)  

Build and validate new models of human lung tissue and chronic lung disease to reduce animal usage and for use as drug discovery and therapeutic screening platforms        

### Impact 
Generating new lung tissue for transplantation could help to overcome the shortages in donor tissue available for patients with end stage lung disease and could further improve long-term survival if stem cells from the eventual transplant recipient are used.  

New models of chronic lung diseases from human-derived sources could help accelerate drug discovery and identify drugs which are the most promising for translation into the clinic.
