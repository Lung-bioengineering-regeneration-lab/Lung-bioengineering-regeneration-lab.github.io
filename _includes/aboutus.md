The Lung Bioengineering and Regeneration (LBR) Lab at Lund University focuses on growing new lung tissue in the lab for transplantation or to use this bioengineered tissue to study how the extracellular environment directs stem cell behavior. We use a multidisciplinary approach using advances in materials science (polymer design and synthesis), manufacturing (e.g. 3D bioprinting), and endogenous lung stem cells to construct this bioengineered tissue and these new models.
